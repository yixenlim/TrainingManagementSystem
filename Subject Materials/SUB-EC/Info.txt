Communication skills include speaking, listening, reading and writing for different purposes. Techniques such as note taking and writing summaries are important, but so, too, are the techniques of evaluation and application, such as evaluating the relevance and quality of information. Communication is part of everyone's life and improving your skills also involves you being able to integrate changes in the way you communicate into your study or work. Essentially, this means you will be improving your skills while communicating what you are learning. This is much more than developing your presentation skills or tackling an essay. It is also about strategically planning how to communicate, applying your skills in different situations, and critically reflecting on your performance, that is being consciously aware of what you are doing and how well you are doing it.
