Diversity extends far beyond race relations in the workplace. It is not only the acceptance of people of color that upper management and CEOs are worried about, it's the acceptance of women, homosexuals and even aging individuals in the workplace. Although there are often complaints that exist due to the diversification in employees who are hired, such as older employees don't feel as though things work as smoothly as they used to; white males complain about being overlooked for promotions; work isn't as much fun with all of the sexual harassment laws and the many other complaints that people can come up with when presented with a diverse workplace. However, diversification ensures that with properly managed employees  and  managers  in leadership positions, the business can do nothing but grow when they expand the personalities, the racial backgrounds and the genders in the workplace.
